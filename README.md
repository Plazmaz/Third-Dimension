Third-Dimension
===============

Third dimension is an abandoned/slightly finished project I worked on for a while, but eventually decided to work on my 3D projects with a pre-written library.This code is in pure java using absolutely no libraries except for those provided with java thanks to Seb Lee(seb.ly) for his posts on 3d projection.
